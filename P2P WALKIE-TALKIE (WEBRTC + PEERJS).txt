PROJECT: ROLE-BASED P2P WALKIE-TALKIE (WEBRTC)
================================================================

1. CORE OBJECTIVE
-----------------
A secure, low-latency PTT app allowing for:
- "All-Call" (Broadcast to the entire group)
- "Role-Call" (Targeted to specific roles, e.g., Managers)
- "Direct-Call" (Private 1-on-1 audio)

2. DATA MODEL (SUPABASE/DATABASE)
---------------------------------
Users need a "Role" and "Status" field:
- UserID: Unique ID (used for PeerJS)
- Name: "John Doe"
- Role: "Manager", "Shipper", "Cashier", or "Staff"
- CurrentRoom: "Warehouse", "Sales Floor"

3. ROUTING LOGIC (THE "WHO HEARS WHAT" FILTER)
----------------------------------------------
A. DIRECT CALL:
   - User selects a specific name.
   - App enables the audio stream ONLY for the connection 
     linked to that User's PeerID.

B. ROLE-BASED CALL (Selective Mesh):
   - User selects "Managers".
   - App filters the active peer list for Role == 'Manager'.
   - Audio tracks are enabled only for those specific connections.

C. THE "ALL-CALL":
   - Standard broadcast to all peers in the current room.

4. UI/UX IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------
- Multi-Button Interface: 
  * Large "Broadcast" button for the whole team.
  * "Quick Toggles" for specific Roles.
  * User list for 1-on-1 private channels.
- Incoming Call Indicator: Shows "Private Call: [Name]" vs 
  "Group Call" to the receiver.

5. TECHNICAL ADVANTAGE
----------------------
- Because this is P2P (WebRTC), a "Private Call" is truly 
  private. The audio data never touches a server, and 
  other users in the room don't even receive the packets.
