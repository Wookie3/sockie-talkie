MOBILE HARDWARE & AUDIO ROUTING PLAN
================================================================

1. HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------
- Built-in Mic/Speaker: Supported (Requires Echo Cancellation).
- Wired Headphones: Supported (Best latency).
- Bluetooth/Wireless: Supported (Standard A2DP/HFP profiles).

2. BROWSER PERMISSIONS
----------------------
- Must request 'microphone' permissions on first interaction.
- Note: iOS Safari requires a "User Gesture" (like clicking a 
  button) before it will play any incoming audio. Your 
  "Join Room" button satisfies this requirement.

3. AUDIO ROUTING LOGIC
----------------------
- Category: 'play-and-record' (This ensures the OS treats the 
  app like a phone call, lowering the volume of other apps).
- Output: Automatically defaults to the system's active 
  audio device (Headphones > Speaker).

4. ADVANCED FEATURE: HEADSET CONTROL
------------------------------------
- Use 'navigator.mediaSession' to map headphone buttons 
  (Play/Pause) to the Push-to-Talk 'Talk' trigger. 
- Allows for "Pocket Mode" operation.

5. USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
-----------------------
- Visual Feedback: Always show a "Mic Active" icon on screen 
  so the user knows their headset is transmitting.
- Beep Tones: Add a "Roger Beep" (short 50ms sine wave) when 
  the button is released, so headphone users know the 
  transmission ended.
